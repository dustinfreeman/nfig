# .gitignore file for Xcode4 / OS X Source projects
#
# Version 2.0
# For latest version, see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/49478/git-ignore-file-for-xcode-projects
#
# 2013 updates:
# - fixed the broken "save personal Schemes"
#
# NB: if you are storing "built" products, this WILL NOT WORK,
# and you should use a different .gitignore (or none at all)
# This file is for SOURCE projects, where there are many extra
# files that we want to exclude

# Xcode private settings (window sizes, bookmarks, breakpoints, custom executables, smart groups)
#
# This is complicated:
#
# SOMETIMES you need to put this file in version control.
# Apple designed it poorly - if you use "custom executables", they are
# saved in this file.
# 99% of projects do NOT use those, so they do NOT want to version control this file.
# ..but if you're in the 1%, comment out the line "*.pbxuser"

# OPTION 1: ---------------------------------
# throw away ALL personal settings (including custom schemes!
# - unless they are "shared")

# OPTION 2: ---------------------------------
# get rid of ALL personal settings, but KEEP SOME OF THEM
# - NB: you must manually uncomment the bits you want to keep

# Xcode 4 - Deprecated classes
#
# Allegedly, if you manually "deprecate" your classes, they get moved here.
#
# We're using source-control, so this is a "feature" that we do not want!
